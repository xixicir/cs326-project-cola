### **Team Overview**
- Name: Hongxi Huang

### **Application Idea**
*wheelx* is a web application I am planning to design for wheels' sales. There will be 4 types of data: parts' names, parts' prices, category and popularity. The web application will be composed of three parts: homepage, shop and about us. There are also some functions such as search, sort and filter in the web application.

### **Functionality**
On the *wheelx*, in order for customer to find their perfect wheels, they can use search and filter to narrow the parts. For the search function, the parts' name with the content in the search text box will be shown. For the filter function, the parts will be filtered by different category. For the sort function, the parts will be reordered base on their price.
